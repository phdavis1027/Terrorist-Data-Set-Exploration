# Terrorist-Data-Set-Exploration

I have a longstanding fascination with the extremes of society, and thought I would take a look at a large dataset
related to terrorist activity. 

My main curiosity is how ideology affects various aspects of a terrorist group's 'performance.'
Ideologies vary widely among groups. For example, while both would be classified as right-wing in this dataset,
QAnon believers and Neo-Nazis are distinct and often mutually hostile groups. 

However, one thing that this study corroborates from other similar surveys is that religiously motivated terrorist
groups are far and away the longest-lasting and most effective. Therefore, the development of religious ideology
among otherwise unreligious extremists (e.g., elevation of a military leader to holy status) or the reverse
phenomenon (fringe religious leaders seeking political power, especially when tied to their ministry), should be viewed
with extreme concern.

Another clear finding is that there is a 20% correlation (p-value ~ 3.41e-8) between number of bases from which a terrorist
group can act and the longevity of their operations.
